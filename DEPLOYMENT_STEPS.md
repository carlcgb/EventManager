# Steps to Enable Google Calendar Integration

## Why Deployment is Required
Google OAuth requires an HTTPS URL for security. In development (localhost), Google won't allow the authentication flow to complete.

## What to Do:

### 1. Deploy the Application
- Click the "Deploy" button in Replit
- Your app will get a public HTTPS URL like: `https://your-app.replit.app`

### 2. After Deployment
Once deployed with an HTTPS URL:
1. Go to "ParamÃ¨tres > IntÃ©grations calendrier" 
2. Click "Connecter" (button will now be enabled)
3. Authorize access to your Google Calendar
4. Create events - they'll sync automatically with ðŸ¤  emoji

### 3. What Will Work
- âœ… Button "Connecter Google" becomes active
- âœ… Google OAuth authorization flow works
- âœ… Events sync to your personal Google Calendar
- âœ… Automatic reminders (1 day + 1 hour before)
- âœ… Events marked with cowboy emoji ðŸ¤ 

## Current Status
- ðŸ”§ Technical setup: Complete (API keys configured)
- ðŸ‘¤ User authentication: Complete (Replit Auth working)
- ðŸ“… Calendar permission: Blocked (needs HTTPS deployment)

The app is ready - deployment will unlock Google Calendar sync!
